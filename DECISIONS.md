# DECISIONS

Append-only log of decisions the engineering manager (EM) took on Rajat's behalf, with the reasoning. Read this to scan what changed and why. Flag any entry in chat to override; the EM will revisit.

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM IST  short title

**Stream:** 0 / A / B / C / D / E / F / G or cross-stream
**Context:** what triggered the decision, one or two sentences.
**Options considered:** the two or three real choices.
**Chosen:** the option and why, plain language.
**Reversibility:** how hard this is to undo if Rajat disagrees.
**Right-size check (per `docs/product.md` §4):** problem size, fix level, generality.
```

Decisions Rajat must approve go in the "Open items" list in `features/phase2.md`, not here. This file is for decisions the EM took without escalation.

## 2026-06-08 12:30 IST — Plan scaffolding shape

**Stream:** G
**Context:** Initial Plantry plan needed a layout. Three candidate shapes considered.
**Options considered:** (a) one combined doc replacing the handoff, (b) separate `PLAN.md` plus EM brief plus decisions log layered on the handoff, (c) edit the handoff in place.
**Chosen:** (b). The handoff is a clean brief and future readers benefit from its original form. Layering an execution plan on top preserves the brief and keeps execution detail separable.
**Reversibility:** easy. All files are docs; deleting or restructuring costs nothing.
**Right-size check:** problem is plan-shape, not code-shape; fix level is documentation; generality: this scaffolding pattern is the EM operating model, reused every session.

## 2026-06-08 13:45 IST — Restructure to Cadence-style doc model

**Stream:** G
**Context:** Rajat read the Cadence repo pattern and asked the docs to follow the same shape: tiny root, four canonical specs in `docs/`, active feature in `features/`, history quarantined in `archive/`.
**Options considered:** (a) keep my initial `PLAN.md` + `EM_brief.md` + `decisions.md` at root, (b) restructure to Cadence shape with `docs/{product,engine,engineering,development}.md` + `CHANGELOG.md` and three root operational docs.
**Chosen:** (b). The Cadence pattern earns its place: canonical docs are present-tense steady-state specs, history is separated from current truth, the maintenance job keeps docs aligned to shipped reality. This matches the philosophy already in `learnings.md` ("decouple display from structure"; here, decouple steady state from chronology).
**Reversibility:** easy. All docs; trivial to flatten back.
**Right-size check:** problem is "docs are not scannable"; fix level is structural (folder layout + canonical-doc discipline); generality: this shape works for every future feature, not just phase 2.

## 2026-06-08 14:10 IST — Hybrid Convex + git runtime

**Stream:** cross-stream
**Context:** Rajat asked why Fly was the recommendation given he has used Convex before. Convex is a managed backend that does not naturally host a git working tree, so adopting it unwinds the markdown-in-git locked decision from the handoff.
**Options considered:** (a) markdown-in-git as locked, hosted on Fly/Railway/Render, (b) hybrid: Convex for runtime state (currentWeek, comments, incidents) + git markdown for structure (library, rules spec, history seed, structural changelog), (c) Convex for everything, dropping git for data entirely.
**Chosen:** (b), confirmed by Rajat. Reasoning: live sync between phones (real engineering win at this scale), free Convex tier, native preview environments, Swiggy MCP integration becomes easier (already structured queryable data), AND git-backed structural review preserved exactly where it matters. Single language across stack (TS everywhere) becomes natural rather than awkward.
**Reversibility:** medium. Moving runtime state out of Convex later means rewriting the runtime layer; the engine and the library data stay portable because they live in git.
**Right-size check:** problem is "runtime topology"; fix level is infrastructure; generality: this enables Swiggy integration, live sync, and preview environments simultaneously.

## 2026-06-08 14:25 IST — Slow loop is human-triggered, not cron

**Stream:** E
**Context:** Original plan put the slow loop on a Sunday 11am IST cron via Convex scheduled functions. Rajat said he will trigger it from a Claude Code session instead.
**Options considered:** (a) Convex cron firing a GitHub Actions workflow, (b) Rajat invokes `/slow-loop` slash command in a Claude Code session.
**Chosen:** (b), per Rajat. This is cleaner: human at both ends (trigger and merge) tightens "record, do not apply", reasoning quality is higher with Claude Code Opus reasoning in-session, no webhook secret to manage, no Convex cron to maintain, Rajat can add context at invocation time ("look especially at this comment").
**Reversibility:** easy. The cron can be added later if manual triggering becomes a chore.
**Right-size check:** problem is "structural changes need a triggering pattern"; fix level is workflow (slash command + slow-loop spec); generality: same pattern reused for `/reconcile-docs`.

## 2026-06-08 13:12 IST — CI structure-check fix on first push

**Stream:** 0
**Context:** First push to `mudgal1729/plantry` triggered the placeholder structure check. The check failed because actions/checkout creates `.git` at the workspace root and my regex did not allow it. Fix is a one-line addition to the allowed pattern.
**Options considered:** (a) fix immediately with a follow-up commit, (b) leave CI red and surface for Rajat to decide.
**Chosen:** (a). A bug in my own stub check is not a judgment call; the right move is to fix and push. The fix is purely additive (allows `.git`), no behavior change.
**Reversibility:** trivial.
**Right-size check:** problem size, one-off; fix level, regex; generality, the allowed set is the canonical root inventory and will need maintenance as the layout evolves; revisit during canonical-doc reconciliation.

## 2026-06-08 14:30 IST — Stack: TypeScript everywhere

**Stream:** cross-stream
**Context:** Hybrid architecture moves the backend to Convex (TS-only). Original plan had Python engine + FastAPI backend + TS frontend.
**Options considered:** (a) keep Python engine, expose to Convex via an HTTP bridge, (b) port engine to TS to live inside Convex functions.
**Chosen:** (b). HTTP bridge adds a moving part for no upside given engine logic is pure functions. One language across engine, Convex functions, frontend, and tests reduces context-switching for Rajat and for any reviewer.
**Reversibility:** medium. The TS engine is portable; if Python is ever needed (e.g., heavy data analysis later), the engine can be reimplemented from `docs/engine.md`.
**Right-size check:** problem is "two languages add accidental complexity for a two-person tool"; fix level is stack selection; generality: TS-everywhere unblocks Convex pattern matching, Vercel preview deployments, MCP integration in TS, all simultaneously.
